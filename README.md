# Drawing-2\
My poster is meant to help ease someone, it is intended to convey a sense of calm and relaxation. My goal for this project was to create a visually appealing poster, that reminds the viewer to take life easy and not get overwhelmed by stress. I used colors to evoke an emotional response and the phrase was meant to encourage viewers to take a moment to breathe and relax.
